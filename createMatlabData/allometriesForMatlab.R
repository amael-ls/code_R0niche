#### Aim of prog: Make the allometries accessible to matlab
#		- A data table for dbh_star and dbh_inf, the lower and upper bounds of the integral
#		- A data table for the allometries (crown--dbh, etc...)
#
#### Units are very messy:
## - Adams2007 (from where the formulae are from):
#		* Growth in cm/yr
# 		* dbh in cm
#		* Height allometry (named H in his paper) in m
## - Purves2008 (from where the values are from):
#		* Growth in cm/yr
# 		* dbh in cm
# 		* Height allometry (named Î± in his paper) in m
## - On my own
#		* Growth in mm
#		* dbh in mm
# It implies I had to convert growth or dbh in some analytical formulae for the allometries

## Asymptotic height and dbh in m and mm respectively (from Burns 1990, Silvics 1 and 2)
# h_inf is the max height in general, and h_inf_max is the max height ever recorded/in optimal condition
# dbh_inf and dbh_inf_max follow the same rules
# For Fagus Grandifolia, it seems there is a mistake in the units. I use the table p. 660
# For Acer rubrum, dbh_inf_max is the bole circumference => does not reflect dbh
